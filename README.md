# Image_sorter
The GUI-Image sorter was created for sorting image to three folders: BAD, GOOD, and STRANGE.
1. "Open Directory" --> Open the catalog with the unsorted image.
2. "Create Folders" --> Create folders: "BAD", "GOOD", "STRANGE".
3. "GO!" --> Start.
4. "move to BAD",
   "move to GOOD",
   "move to STRANGE": 
                     -- > Moving images to the desired folder
